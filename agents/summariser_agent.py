PHASE 3 — SUMMARISER AGENT
================================================================================
Module  : agents/summariser_agent.py
Purpose : Takes the top-ranked papers from Phase 2 and generates plain-English
          summaries using Mistral 7B Instruct hosted on HuggingFace Inference API.

Why Mistral 7B Instruct?
    - Best-in-class open-source model for instruction following & summarisation
    - "Instruct" variant = fine-tuned to follow directions precisely
    - Runs on HuggingFace's free Inference API (no GPU needed on our end)
    - Fast enough for a daily newsletter pipeline (~5-10 sec per paper)

How summarisation works:
    1. We craft a carefully designed PROMPT for each paper
    2. The prompt instructs Mistral to explain the paper as if talking to
       a curious non-technical friend — no jargon, just clear insight
    3. Mistral returns a structured summary with: headline, what it is,
       why it matters, and a real-world analogy
    4. We parse and attach the summary back to the Paper object

HuggingFace Inference API:
    - Endpoint : https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/{model_id}
    - Auth     : Bearer token (HF_TOKEN from .env)
    - Free tier: Rate limited but sufficient for daily newsletter (5 papers/day)
    - Docs     : https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference
